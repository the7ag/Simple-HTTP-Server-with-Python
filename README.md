# Simple HTTP Server with Python
This repository contains a simple Python script that creates an HTTP server and serves an "index.html" file with a "Hello World" message.

# Requirements
To run the Python script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/the7ag/simple-http-server-python.git

```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd simple-http-server-python
```
# Usage

To start the HTTP server, run the following command:
```
python3 server.py
```
This will start the server on port 80. You can access it by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:80/.

The server will serve an "index.html" file that contains a "Hello World" message displayed as a header.

# Customization
If you want to serve a different HTML file, you can simply replace the "index.html" file with your own file. Make sure to keep the file name as "index.html" so that the server serves it as the default page.

If you want to use a different port number, you can edit the PORT variable in the "server.py" file to set it to the desired port number.
